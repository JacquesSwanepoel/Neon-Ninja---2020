# Neon-Ninja---2020
One of the first games I tried to develop. A 2D platformer inspired by a youtuber I was watching at the time.

I was very inspired by a youtuber named JustFredrik, he was working on a 2D platformer named "CandleHead". I was so inspired that I mercilessly traced over his artwork and used it for this project. 

I didn't really have a plan for this game, more just a vision of what it could be, but my very limited art and devs skills cought up to me.

I did manage to create something though, I even showed it to every person I could think of.

Here is a screenshot of the "most recent" release. It barely has gameplay, but I'm proud of it as the first project I worked on without help or direction.

The project files for this project is lost to time, however I still have some builds and assets I made for the game. I will upload them here and you can explore through them at your own leisure.
